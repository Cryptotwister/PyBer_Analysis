# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
Pyber is a python based riding app company. We need to create several types of visualizations that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides, sum of fares as well as the percentage of total fares, rides and drivers by type of city. Additionally, we are asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## The purpose of the new analysis:
The analysis and visualizations we produce should help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We present our findings in [PyBer_Challenge.ipnyb](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb).

## Results:


If we compare the average number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 3.5 and 2.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.


There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
