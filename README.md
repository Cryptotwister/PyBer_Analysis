# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
PyBer is a python-based riding app company. We need to create several types of visualizations that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides, sum of fares as well as the percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers by type of city. Additionally, we are asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## The purpose of the new analysis:
The analysis and visualizations we produce should help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We present our findings in [PyBer_Challenge.ipnyb](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb).

## Results:
* There are 120 cities where PyBer establishes its operations:
1. 18 cities of type Rural.
2. 36 cities of type Suburban.
3. 66 cities of type Urban.

##### The results of our analysis can be found in the following table below:

## Summary:
If we compare the data in our findings, we'll notice that the total fares, rides, and number of drivers in urban cities dominate with big advancement. It is very well represented with the pie charts that we have prepared:

![Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42978221/144779284-2cd5e80a-95a3-4063-be7c-dcc8026d8e16.png)

Over the time under assessment urban cities generate revenue of above $ 2,000 per week, while the rural cities average around $200 per week. This is a huge difference that definitely needs to be addressed.
